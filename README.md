# 🏄‍♂️ Aymen Abdelmalik BOUNAB

I am an Engineer, highly motivated, results-driven full-stack developer. I am very passionate about solving business owners problems and turning mind stories into real life projects.

In September 2023, I started learning software development, i have learned the basics using **C++**, and then i choose to work with .Net ecosystem so i took online courses in **C#**, **.Net Framework**, **ADO.Net**, **SqlServer**, **Ef Core**, **.Net Core**, **ASP.Net**, **RESTfull APIs** ...and more.

🧭 Outside the world of tech, I like pushing myself to develop new skills and enjoy my hobbies.
